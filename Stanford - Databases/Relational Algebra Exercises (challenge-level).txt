Relational Algebra Exercises (challenge-level)

These problems are more challenging than those in the core set. Try them out to test your skills (and perhaps earn a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction). 

In this assignment you are to write relational algebra queries over a small database, executed using our RA Workbench. Behind the scenes, the RA workbench translates relational algebra expressions into SQL queries over the database stored in SQLite. Since relational algebra symbols aren't readily available on most keyboards, RA uses a special syntax described in our RA Relational Algebra Syntax guide. 

We've created a small sample database to use for this assignment. It contains four relations:
    Person(name, age, gender)       // name is a key
    Frequents(name, pizzeria)       // [name,pizzeria] is a key
    Eats(name, pizza)               // [name,pizza] is a key
    Serves(pizzeria, pizza, price)  // [pizzeria,pizza] is a key
View the database. (You can also download the schema and data.) 

Instructions: You are to write relational algebra expressions over the pizza database. We strongly suggest that you work the queries out on paper first, using conventional relational algebra symbols. When you click "Check Answer" our back-end runs your query against the sample database. It displays the result and compares your answer against the correct one. When you're satisfied with your solution for a given problem, click the "Save Answers" button to save your progress. Click "Submit Answers" to submit the entire exercise set. 

Please Note: You are to translate the English into an expression that computes the desired result over all possible databases. All we actually check is that your query gets the right answer on the small sample database. Thus, even if your solution is marked as correct, it is possible that your query does not correctly reflect the problem at hand. (For example, if we ask for a complex condition that requires accessing all of the tables, but over our small data set in the end the condition is satisfied only by Amy, then the query "\project_{name} (\select_{name='Amy'} Person)" will be marked correct even though it doesn't reflect the actual question.) Circumventing the system in this fashion will get you a high score on the exercises, but it won't help you learn relational algebra. On the other hand, an incorrect attempt at a general solution is unlikely to produce the right answer, so you shouldn't be led astray by our checking system. 

You may perform these exercises as many times as you like, so we strongly encourage you to keep working with them until you complete the exercises with full credit. 

Question 1

Find all pizzas that are eaten only by people younger than 24, or that cost less than $10 everywhere they're served.

((\project_{pizza} (\select_{age<24} Person \join Eats))
 \diff (\project_{pizza} (\select_{age>=24} Person \join Eats)))
 \union 
((\project_{pizza} \select_{price<10} Serves) \diff (\project_{pizza} \select_{price>=10} Serves))

Question 2

Find the age of the oldest person (or people) who eat mushroom pizza.

(\project_{age} (Person \join (\select_{pizza='mushroom'} Eats)))
 \diff  
(\project_{one} \select_{one < two} (\rename_{one,two} 
 ((\project_{age} (Person \join (\select_{pizza='mushroom'} Eats)))
  \cross 

  Question 3

Find all pizzerias that serve only pizzas eaten by people over 30.

(\project_{pizzeria} (Serves \join ((\select_{age > 30} Person) \join Eats)))
 \diff 
(\project_{pizzeria} (Serves \join ((\project_{pizza} Serves) \diff (\project_{pizza} ((\select_{age > 30} Person) \join Eats)))))


Question 4

Find all pizzerias that serve every pizza eaten by people over 30.

\project_{pz1}(\select_{pz1=pz2 and p1<>p2 and p1<p2}(\rename_{pz1,p1,pz2,p2}(
(\project_{pizzeria,pizza} (Serves \join ((\select_{age > 30} Person) \join Eats)))
 \cross 
(\project_{pizzeria,pizza} (Serves \join ((\select_{age > 30} Person) \join Eats)))
)))
